<div class="content">
  <p> at any rate so say the peirceans, intergalactic anthropologists come
    back from the future, who've taken their on-site name from our very
    own charles sanders peirce</p>
  <p class="red indented">[pronounced 'purse', thus 'PUR shuns';&nbsp; they
    see peirce as a prophet of the age of puteracy, and, incidentally,
    call us "imputerates"];</p>
  <p>i'm paraphrasing here [hector leary has a <a href="hector.html"> better take </a> 
    on this stuff than i do], but the peirceans contend that literacy and
    the piety which perpetuates it constitute a sociopathology, somewhere
    in between what we call superstition and mob hysteria... in short, a
    complex of broadly shared hallucinations of the sort that plague
    schizophrenics; </p>
  <p>and little wonder, they say: literacy's beginnings signal our first
    tentative steps out of tribal xenophobia toward global linguistic
    interaction [a gregarious sociability unique to our species];&nbsp;
    spurred by material necessity and fostered by mercantile enterprise,
    this venturing forth from the ancestral hearth was entirely compatible
    with the essential human impetus, our innate curiosity;&nbsp; at this
    early stage, however, as we exploited "social" occasions to exchange,
    say, woven baskets for dried fish, we turned out to be ill prepared
    for cultural interpenetration; </p>
  <p>you see, long before the era of literacy, having spent untold
    millenia gripped by mute, mind numbing primordial terror </p>
  <p class="red indented">[after all, we were the only sentient beings on the planet],</p>
    we had recourse first to oral language as a means of relating to our
    environment and to each other;&nbsp; but in the pre-literate era of
    orality, language functioned only as a metonymic tool;&nbsp; impulsive
    cries and onomatopoeic utterances, then articulated words, we
    discovered, could be used to represent things;&nbsp; naming things
    with words encouraged us to see ways in which these things were
    related;&nbsp; and so, by extension, we realized that things once
    named and clustered could stand in for other things;&nbsp; that's
    metonymy; </p>
  <p>systematic, and shared, metonymic associations were essential to our
    early spiritual growth; for example, the overwhelming anomaly of death
    [which left even the creatures we totemized evidently unperturbed],
    could, it turned out, be negotiated; all we had to do was project
    phenomena like the seasonal cycle of a tree's death and regeneration
    onto a putative scenario for our own demise and after-life;&nbsp; at
    the same time, as we hit upon more complex verbal gestures for
    manipulating each another, there evolved analogous protocols for
    propitiating the nameable forces of nature, like for instance the one
    in charge of the neighborhood fish supply; </p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; &bull;</p>
  <p>so far, so good: prayers and curses sway the gods if one is pious,
    and fortunate;&nbsp; time is obviously cyclical [diurnal, lunar,
    seasonal cycles], hence once we get the rite right, it's fixed for
    good;&nbsp; &#191;time again to go fishing?&nbsp; No problem!&nbsp;
    just invoke the appropriate supernatural facilitator, toss a few
    virgins into the local volcano [chanting the while] and get on with
    it; </p>
  <p>gradually, with time and the inexorable progress of technology </p>
<p class="red indented">[as sentient beings we were inclined by curiosity to
    at least rudimentary empirical procedures, no matter how scared
    we were],</p>
    humans formed societal groups, domesticated sectors of their
    environment and developed specialized skills like making fibres, then
    using the fibres to make fishing nets and baskets;&nbsp; and once
    heretofore xenophobic communities could, in the event of a shortfall
    of fish, come across with a surplus of woven baskets, they began to
    engage in the mutually beneficial exchange of goods;&nbsp;
    fortunately, models for this dicey business were at hand, for instance
    in the way intra-tribal clans had seen to it that a young man from
    clan B mated not with a sibling, but with the daughter of his mother's
    brother, from clan A;&nbsp; this type of social interaction, then as
    now always elaborately verbalized, established ritual patterns of
    contact and even traffic among potentially hostile groups </p>
  <p class="red indented">[lateral conjugal access; women migrating from clan A to clan B, and
    into the menage of a "mother-in-law"];</p>
    just as we had confronted death by drawing on our verbal resources,
    so the challenge of extensive cultural interpenetration prompted us
    humans to invoke the mysterious power of language; </p>
  <p>consequently, incipient bartering entailed the exchange of verbal
    rituals;&nbsp; an example: certain pacific island groups are known to
    have come together only at elaborately determined intervals and, once
    they had secreted their surplus goods, to launch into extended
    recitations of their respective sacramental formulae, as if that were
    the point of the encounter;&nbsp; only after the ceremony was
    completed would they part company, each, by tacit agreement, toting
    off the other's stash; another example: australian aborigines, at the
    point of entering a neighbor's territory, have been observed reciting
    the chants they grew up with, and then learning those of their
    hosts;&nbsp; proceeding to a further domain entailed mastering another
    set of songs, and so on; </p>
  <p>now the only trouble with this expedient is that it led to an
    unsettling awareness among the various interacting groups that their
    congruent verbal formulae didn't jibe; </p>
  <p class="red indented">["we've got that thing with the virgins and the volcano for
    when it's time to go fishing, while they do something
    unspeakable to barely pubic little boys... and they're the ones
    who got all the fish, which is why we're here in the first
    place;&nbsp; &#191;is it possible that our verbal behaviors, and the
    attendant rituals they define, are maybe not so absolutely,
    irrevocably, 'right on'?"]</p>
  <p>well, that last disconcerting notion took a while to
    sink in;&nbsp; in fact its acknowledgement was largely unspoken;&nbsp;
    but with time it became obvious that the appurtenances of piety,
    verbal and otherwise, were the product of idiosyncratic figuration,
    when not of wholly arbitrary contingencies;&nbsp; but, as hjelmslev
    has taught us, natural language, the "passkey" semiotic, was the one
    most appropriate for strategic manipulation [compared to human
    sacrifice and circumcision, which could be simply sublimated or
    rescheduled];&nbsp; consequently, incantatory formulae began to take
    on the form of defensive, self justifying accounts;&nbsp; in effect,
    the new incantations-become-stories ended up holding their proponents
    "accountable" to the very gods they were losing contact with, and for
    that matter, the other way 'round, too; </p>
  <p>narrating truths did not, in itself, firm up the shaky status of
    those truths;&nbsp; but with time the resultant myths did provide more
    and more articulate ammunition for fending off unwelcome intrusions
    into each discrete realm of orthodoxy;&nbsp; and the more complex the
    rationalizing strategies of its ceremonial texts, the easier it was
    for each truth to ignore the peculiarities which distinguished it from
    other, analogous truths;&nbsp; along with this sophistication of
    devotional orality, the business of marking primitive tokens down in
    clay ledgers [the original accounting procedure, remember?] was
    evolving to the point where full blown orthodox narratives, precarious
    but no less precious to their now fully literate proponents, could be
    recorded in the form of imperishable, eventually alphabetic,
    texts;&nbsp; it was nietzsche who said that when people cease to
    believe their hallowed myths, they hasten to write them down;&nbsp;
    sure enough!&nbsp; sooner or later, nearly all the various local
    versions of pescatory propitiation got enshrined in written form; </p>
  <p>this did at least provide for the slim possibility that if "our"
    version were, after all, the right one, the record would make damn'
    sure we didn't forget it; </p>
  <p class="red indented">[at this point, no one had gone so far as to suggest there
    weren't any gods at all, so hunkering down with the hearth
    dieties was the only option; to that end, vicaring, like
    basketry, was cultivated as a pragmatic tribal
    specialization;]</p>
    only, Yikes!&nbsp; &#191;guess what happened once we started writing
    down all that stuff?&nbsp; it turned out that stories change over
    time;&nbsp; that had never occured to anyone;&nbsp; as parry and lord
    discovered, illiterate slavic bards in the balkans, as recently as a
    century ago, were convinced that they recited the same text, the one
    and only text, every time they told a given story; </p>
  <p>change over time: this new concept was catastrophic for organized
    belief;&nbsp; not only were the holy texts an arbitrary crock, they
    weren't even constant, and if they changed over time that meant
    everything changed, and kept changing, over and over time, and instead
    of reiterating those reassuring, self contained cycles [including
    life-cycles] time took on the contour of an infinite, careening roller
    coaster ride, heading who [&#191;god?] knows where... </p>
  <p>well, here was another anomaly too big to ignore;&nbsp; linear change
    proved even scarier than mortality, and simple metonymy [tropes] was
    not enough to handle it, which brings us to the problematic origins of
    literacy; with literacy, language behavior took on another dimension
    of meaning, pursued on the rhetorical level of symbolism;&nbsp; as
    prayers and curses evolved into written narratives [in effect
    imaginative prose, rhythmic, rhymed or no], their topoi [characters,
    settings and events] assumed positive or negative charges, and were
    deployed along the new <a href="05.madman7.html"> 
    linear chronological vector;&nbsp; </a> in effect, cyclical time schemes ended up morphing into allegorical
    plots [skewed in favor of home grown mythical forces] whose
    unidirectional cause and effect apparatus was harnessed by petitioners
    as well as tracked and, it was hoped surreptitiously manipulated, by
    the implicated gods;&nbsp; as men strove to get some sort of a handle
    on the chaotic progress of events they would come to call history,
    their ingenuous incantation of parochial myths was appropriated to
    promote a more urgent agenda, the propagation of prescriptive truth; </p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; &bull;</p>
  <p>the evolution of language can be seen as the gradual overcoming of
    fear by innate human curiosity;&nbsp; the first level of figuration,
    the one which determined the epistemological grasp of orality, was
    representation, per se;&nbsp; in this, at least, chomsky must be
    right;&nbsp; our species is hard-wired for the business of labelling
    things and coordinating their signifiers [tropes] into
    templates;&nbsp; a second, cumulative, dimension of meaning was gained
    by attaching symbolic value to topoi, thereby assigning them
    allegorical roles in the ongoing drama of good vs. evil;&nbsp;
    history, the triumph of literacy, is itself an unwitting allegory of
    our reason's struggle against chaotic change; </p>
  <p>the first civilizations of the tigris euphrates valley, with their
    cuneiform tablets, represent the beginning of literacy's progress from
    symbolicized orthodoxy to the enlightenment, from the hope that one or
    more gods will see to it that right thinking folks get taken care of,
    to the understanding that we would do well to take matters into our
    own hands;&nbsp; while incantations had enjoyed the status of magic
    among the proto-literate, fully literate myths and legends were merely
    true, hence sacred, and up to the renaissance, iconic [where plot is a
    reflex of character, as in saints' lives];&nbsp; then came unabashed
    fiction [the ultimate liar's paradox];&nbsp; the picaresque novel was
    a playful experiment [the peripatetic character's misadventures
    provided the pretext for a string of entertaining plot events];&nbsp;
    the evolving "realistic" novel [which presumes to chart the reciprocal
    illumination of character and plot event] provided the final vehicle
    for prescriptive truth as the age of reason devolved into
    sentimentality during the course of the 19th century; </p>
  <p>the declaration of independence thus marks the high point of an
    epistemological evolution, from the word as magic to the word as
    truth;&nbsp; science and rational thinking, resurrected from their
    antique sources, had freed us from the more crippling encumbrances of
    piety by the late 18th century, and we confidently embarked on a quest
    for Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness; but it has gradually
    become clear that our apprehension in the face of death, and the
    helplessness we feel caught up in the turmoil of infinite mutability,
    are just two symptoms of our psychological distress, and all along
    presaged a confrontation with a third and even more devastating
    anomaly, namely, affective human isolation;&nbsp never mind our
    mortality or moral frailty;&nbsp; &#191;what do they matter since
    we're all, every single one of us, ultimately alone, just as beckett,
    the ultimate modernist, says [and what about rabelais, cervantes,
    sterne, and dostoevsky before him]? </p>
  <p>modernism, the final stage of functioning literacy, is effecting a
    transition from literacy to puteracy;&nbsp; in response to isolation
    angst it has embraced a third cumulative dimension of figuration, for
    which the peirceans use our term metaphorization;&nbsp; in their view,
    the metaphor comprehends writing and reading as a reciprocal
    act;&nbsp; a good thing, too: peirce has taught us that words cannot
    be static labels for things, and the experience of a couple of world
    wars suggests that down home heroics is a chimera, so it looks like
    neither tropes nor topoi in themselves are reliable figural
    memes;&nbsp; as a matter of fact, the literati of proto-modernism,
    like gogol, had already figured that out, which is why they chose to
    tamper with a third, superordinate rhetorical level, namely,
    discourse:&nbsp; <a href="05.madman7.html"> "&#191;
    who is encoding, who is recoding, and why?" </a> 
    &nbsp; this, it turns out, will be the bailiwick of the puterati; </p>
  <p>now, of course, the simple logistics of communication dictates
    that all three levels of rhetoric must be operative at once, no matter
    how primitive or decadently deconstructed the languge behavior in
    question;&nbsp; to take first the broadest and narrowest dimensions of
    figuration:&nbsp; there has to be an encoder-recoder relationship, concrete
    or imputed, for language to evolve in the first place [were there such
    a thing as a wolf-boy, he would be mute], and there has to be an
    explicit inventory of mutually understandable tropes for that
    relationship to function linguistically ["How 'bout them
    Raiders!"];&nbsp; furthermore, as the quote demonstrates, there has to
    be a topical context, a plot or argument, which obtains at an
    intermediary level between discourse and lexicon, although it is
    mostly implicit;&nbsp; as language behavior evolved from its first
    oral utterances, through the ever more empirical stages of literacy,
    to the current turmoil of incipient puteracy, it was always 
    <a href="06.bears.html"> phenomenologically 3-D </a>
    but it is the awareness among humans of one, then two, then three
    cumulative dimensions of figurative meaning which has determined its
    conceptual grasp; </p>
  <p>now, one might well ask: &#191;if isolation, the "ultimate"
    challenge facing our linguistic coping apparatus, calls into question
    the basis of communication itself, what good are magic and truth, even
    incrementally, to say nothing of rhetorical hand shakes?&nbsp; well,
    just as we must grudgingly deny the figures of metonym and symbol
    their decisive roles in the determination of meaning, so we will no
    doubt find that metaphor, a rapport between ostensibly incongruous
    signs and signers </p>
  <p class="red indented">[not the subordination of 'vehicle' to 'tenor', as i. a. richards had
    it],</p>
    won't provide the ultimate answer to life's anomalies, but will
    instead just be the major utility in puteracy's rhetorical
    toolbox;&nbsp; &#191;and, besides, who knows how many more anomalies
    we have to look forward to? </p>
  <p>in any event, for now we know there is only one 'us', the
    brotherhood of man, on our lonely planet;&nbsp; there are others, like
    the peirceans, who know about us, but we are light years, literally,
    from encountering them;&nbsp; and every one of us is an entity unto
    himself;&nbsp; we are wasting our time invoking dieties, and railing
    against wrong thinking enemies;&nbsp; just as we once conscribed
    incantatory voodoo into our reasoned quest for stability, the only way
    to deal with our individual isolation now is to subordinate our
    concern with right and wrong truths to our need for rapport;&nbsp; we
    have to negotiate with each other as neighbors;&nbsp; the
    preoccupation of the final stage of literacy won't be the reverent
    semantics of metonymy, or the ethics of adversarial symbolization, but
    the metaphoric approximations which obtain [go ahead, say it one final
    time] "at the third, superordinate level of rhetoric";&nbsp; dialog is
    what will allow us to seek each other out as ultimately congruent,
    thus compatible creatures; anyway, so say those peirceans;</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; &bull;</p>
