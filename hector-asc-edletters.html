 <h5>HECTOR'S LETTERS</h5>

 It appears that Hector persisted in his attempts to garner moral
support, if not technical assistance, for at least a couple of
years. He wrote to several periodicals and then started to email web
sites, like those chronicling UFO sightings, where he hoped to find a
sympathetic ear.
 Although the first letter, along with perhaps a few others, was actually
published [tongue-in-cheek?], by and large Hector met with a deafening, anyway
discouraging, silence. This brought him to the point where he made the
courageous decision to work up his own site and blog.
 We are trying to locate and archive as many of the longer pieces, the
letters and emails, as possible, and will publish them here. As for
the <a href="hector-asc-blog">BLOG</a>, reconstructing that is problematic, but we are making progress.
