    THE THREE BEARS
  </center>
  <p> let's look at 3-D figuration in terms of some familiar images, like
    the mascot insignia college students use to denote themselves... even
    paint themselves;&nbsp; these figures present us, first, with a
    clearly defined SIGNIFIER, [X];&nbsp; in the case of, say, ucla, it's
    a cute bear [the "bruin"];&nbsp; symmetrically, we grasp an
    unambiguous SIGNIFIED [Y], i.e., UCLA [the institution]; </p>
  <p class="diagram">[X] --> [Y]</p>
  <p> the cute bear is what you find emblazoned on sweat-shirts, baseball
    caps, and the like;&nbsp; modernism reaches beyond this kind of
    unproblematic METONYMY;&nbsp; we cannot grasp the meaning of beckett's
    "Company", or gogol's "Diary of a Madman", by dismissing their
    narrators with a logo/label like "disabled"..., and just leave it at
    that;
  </p>
  <p> neither do these obdurate monologues yield up a satisfying
    SYMBOL;&nbsp; pe`res goriot, their "heroes" are not!;&nbsp; this means
    we can't approach them as one does the impressive, realistic statue of
    a bear which enthusiastic alumni recently erected on the ucla
    campus;&nbsp; but let's look at the way that figure works:&nbsp; the
    relatum in evidence, a bronze likeness of <i>ursus arctos</i> at the
    epicenter of the campus, is like its reductive metonymic counterpart,
    the grinning cartoon bear, insofar as it is unambiguously defined; </p>
  <p class="diagram">[X]</p>
  <p> but the complementary side of the relation, the one which
    i. a. richards called the TENOR, is not simply DENOTED, as in a
    metonym, </p>
  <p class="diagram">[X] --></p>
  <p> instead, it is CONNOTED; </p>
  <div class="diagram">
    <pre>
               >  [A]
       /
[X]  { -- &gt;  [B]
       \
               >  [C]
	</pre>
  </div>
  <p> this means it comprises an entire constellation of associations, like
    for instance the wide open western frontier, and primeval power;&nbsp;
    every weekend that big ole scary bear lets busloads of tourists know: </p>
  <p class="red indented"> "This ain't The Ivy League!" </p>
  <p> at the same time, he also creates a palpable impression of what he
    is, what he represents, and how we, or any right thinking person,
    should feel about him;&nbsp; go ahead and try imposing this sort of
    construal on an image like beckett's </p>
  <p class="red indented"> "In another dark or in the same another 
    devising it all for company" </p>
  <p> now, we could try to ferret out meaning in modernist prose by
    resorting to a more subtle ploy for construing literary symbols;&nbsp;
    we could assume the perspective called "point-of-view" which informs
    the modern short story; </p>
  <p class="red indented"> [the short story is an incipiently modernist genre which evolved in
    america and russia in the middle third of the 19th century;] </p>
  <p> point-of-view is orthogonal, as it were, to the relentless linear
    plot line of a novel;&nbsp; it raises the issue of subjectivity,
    eccentric or, what's worse, multiple takes on the nature of characters
    and events; but even from this perspective, we will still fall short
    of engaging any fully modernist narrative persona, even the
    first-person ones;&nbsp; consider for a moment ferdinand, the voice in
    celine's "Mort a' credit" or francie, patrick mccabe's "Butcher
    Boy";&nbsp; if either were a reliable SYMBOL, we could at least start
    by saying that his naivity, his narratological incompetence and
    unreliable subjectivity, tell us something about his personality,
    maybe even raise issues about his integrity; </p>
  <p class="red indented"> [dostoevsky is always inviting us to take this route, and at
    first glance it's tempting, not only for relating to the
    prose of putative pimply adolescents, but for distancing
    ourselves from importunate adult literary hacks as well;] </p>
  <p> but as we learn from our encounter with the <a href="05.madman7.html">madman's</a> canine correspondents, this doesn't get us even close to what's really
    going on; </p>
  <p class="red indented"> ["to start with,&nbsp; &#191;if our storyteller is so lame, what
    about us?&nbsp; &#191;are we so much smarter?&nbsp; &#191;so then what
    are we doing hanging in, page after page?&nbsp; well, it's 'cause we
    can't put the friggin' book down, don't you see;&nbsp; &#191;but why
    are we helpless to explain how much fun these pieces are?&nbsp;
    &#191;and what about the ravishing beauty of their prose?&nbsp; there
    must be something more complex than a symbol operating here, something
    more demanding of us, as readers, than just deciding whether or not to
    root for [or against] some hapless story teller;]" </p>
  <p> the most important thing to realize about symbols in this connection
    is that, in spite of their expansive construals, no reciprocity of
    revealed meaning obtains between their vehicles and their
    tenors;&nbsp; a mean bear may connote California, but California does
    not mean a bear; </p>
  <div class="diagram">
    <pre>

                        &gt; [ASSOCIATION #1] 
                      / 
[UCLA'S SCARY BEAR] { -- &gt; [BEAR IN THE WOODS]
                      \
                        &gt; [ASSOCIATION #3]

	</pre>
  </div>
  <p> this is important because modernist fiction is a dialogic construct,
    where it's the relationship between the figural teller and his
    audience [us] which is primary;&nbsp; the first words gogol published,
    in "Dikan'ka Tales", are our own; </p>
  <p> to imagine a rhetorical juxtaposition whose relata are both
    open-ended like the signifieds of a symbol, and also reciprocal, we
    need a conceptual framework which is more generous, hospitable to
    curiosity;&nbsp; it has to comprehend not just the figure's evaluative
    associations, but its DEPLOYMENT and its CONSTRUAL [&#191;who is
    encoding, who is recoding, and why?] as a two-way vector; </p>
  <p> imagine, then, that early on saturday morning after the big game, a
    bleary eyed ucla student making his way toward the student union to
    grab a cup of coffee discovers that instead of the scary bear...,
    there is a huge statue of a trojan warrior commanding the plaza; </p>
  <p class="red indented"> [we'll set aside for the moment totemic association
    [#1]:&nbsp; the public humiliation of those curators at the
    Met, and [#2]:&nbsp; an unintended, one would hope,
    coincidence with a common mercantile trademark;] </p>
  <p> meanwhile, his equally discomfited counterparts across town at arch
    rival USC are contemplating the hated, but now recontextualized and
    somehow unfamiliar, UCLA bear; </p>
  <p> the word meta-phora [trans-fer] is what it says on the sides of
    moving vans in athens: and that's the clue to what we're dealing with;
    the once symbolic relata in this now metaphoric construct, by being
    exchanged, have been transferred into a provocative juxtaposition; </p>
  <div class="diagram">
    <pre>
 [' ]  &lt;                                            &gt;  [ ']             
         \			                  /                      
[' ]  &lt; -- } [TROJAN WARRIOR] <--> [SCARY BEAR] { -- &gt;  [ ']  
         /                                        \                      
 [' ]  &lt;                                            &gt;  [ ']             
	</pre>
  </div>
  <p> they are on the same footing;&nbsp; we don't take sides, because we
    are startled into seeing how these totems are congruent;&nbsp; it's no
    longer about winning and losing [&#191;is art really ever about
    that?];&nbsp; who won the day before would not, in fact, be a relevant
    factor as one speculated about the perpetrators of this
    blasphemy;&nbsp; its construal entails reexamining the totems, not in
    their former adversarial context, but in a new, rhetorically congenial
    relationship; </p>
  <p> which brings us to the 'reciprocal' part of modernist figuration;
    from a dynamic metaphorical juxtaposition like this one, we can learn
    as much about one relatum as we do about the other;&nbsp; this follows
    ineluctably from the realization that they are compatible, and leads,
    in its turn, to the promise of new corroborative meanings;&nbsp;
    &#191;for example, mightn't an observer at some remove from the ardor
    of undergraduate tribal loyalties reflect on the homicide rate among
    young men wearing different colored insignia out on the streets of los
    angeles?&nbsp; &#191;couldn't he conclude that the kind of privileged,
    dilettante totemism signified by either of these sacred images is in
    questionable taste, anyway trivial?  Some such thought must have
    occurred to the students of the UC system's very young santa cruz
    campus, because they chose a yellow banana slug for their mascot; </p>
  <p> modernist literary discourse is the yellow banana slug of western
    literature;&nbsp; its rhetoric does, of course, enlist figures of
    STYLE, the ones that demand no more than our picking up on the
    malapropisms of sitcom characters or hacks;&nbsp; and it also deploys
    figures of PLOT, the ones which invite us to relate the sociolectic
    provenance of the narrator to his predicament or even his point of
    view;&nbsp; but having set us up with such familiar metonyms and
    symbols, modernism goes a step further and deploys against us full
    blown metaphors;&nbsp; and their purview is literary DISCOURSE itself:
    not just dialogs between author and reader, but an entire series of
    cumulative dialogic relations ranging from the problematic fit between
    signified and signifier at the level of individual words </p>
  <p class="red indented"> [a rock group called 'pavement';&nbsp; a protagonist called 'shelf
    life'] </p>
  <p> to dialogs between the past and the future, like the dynamic
    relationship between any individual work and its tradition </p>
  <p class="red indented"> [dostoevsky's underground man, rousseau's confessions... and
    st. augustine's];</p>
  <p> modernism is deconstructing [you should pardon the expression]
    literacy itself, in the name of puteracy; </p>
